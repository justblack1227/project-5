#Project 5 

With this project, a employee directory app will be created. In here you will find:
- Requests for using a public API. 
- Working with a public API
- Asynchronously handling the data returned fro the request
- Displaying the data dynamically through uses of CSS Selectors.
- Vanilla javascript that doesn't use the snippets or plugins.
